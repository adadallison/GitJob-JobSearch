Team project for Software Engineering that used Javascript, React, MySQL, and HTML/CSS. This purpose of this web app is to help SFSU students find job openings in tech, as well as recruiters from tech companies post job openings. The student or recruiters can register, sign in, save listed jobs, and learn about different fields in tech. Their name, login info, and saved jobs are stored in a SQL data base.
